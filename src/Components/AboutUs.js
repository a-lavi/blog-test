What is BoardGame?

BoardGameGeek is an online resource and community that aims to be the definitive source for board game and card game content. The site is updated on a real-time basis by its large and still growing user base — more than two million registered users! — making the Geek the largest and most up-to-date place to get gaming information! You can become a registered member of BGG for free, although we welcome your contributions to the site in the form of ratings, reviews, and thoughts on games to the existing database!

BGG features reviews, ratings, images, play-aids, translations, and session reports from board game geeks around the world, as well as live discussion forums. In addition, every day nearly a hundred game trades pass through the hands of registered members, as well as transactions in the Geek Market. If you are new to the site and are wondering where to begin, you might start with the Guide to BoardGameGeek.

What kind of games are here?

Here you'll find many types of board games, including thousands you've probably never seen in a store! We cover not only board games but also dice games, card games, tile-laying games, and games of dexterity. We have abstracts, economic games, dungeon crawls, city building, diplomacy and negotiation, trading, puzzle games, strategy games, party games, war games, and many more. We run the gamut from the light and whimsical Carcassonne to the serious and heavy empire-building of Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition. Well-known games like Monopoly exist in the database as well, although you'll find almost all users prefer modern games that exhibit advancements in game play and component quality since Monopoly was first published.
